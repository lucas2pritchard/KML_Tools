**#How to use**
Download the repo, scripts that you want to run are in an the lib folder. The main directory has a parent executable that activates these scripts on a directory of show choice. 

1 - When you run the executable you select the directory that has the files you want to edit
2 - Select the file in the folder
3 - Select the modification you want to perform
4 - Run the command

You can add custom scripts by adding an additional script and using setting the main function of the script as "def edit_kml(inputfile)"
